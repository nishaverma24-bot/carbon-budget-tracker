Total annual gross emissions decreased by 50% between 2019 and 2050, reaching a value of 6,700 GgCO2eq, thanks to the reductions achieved in the Energy and AFOLU sectors. In addition, the environmental protection and reforestation actions included in the Mitigation scenario result in a 23% increase in the country's absorption capacity. Thus, under the Mitigation scenario, Equatorial Guinea manages to reduce its emissions by 420% total annual net emissions between 2019 and 2050, reaching a carbon negative balance in 2050 with annual net emissions of -7,300 GgCO2eq.""",Negative emissions of -7.3 MtCO2e in 2050,Quantified Long-term Emissions Goal Included in LTS,Net-zero Target Included in LTS,Net-zero Target Included in LTS,"""The global response was significantly strengthened with the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, during COP21.
